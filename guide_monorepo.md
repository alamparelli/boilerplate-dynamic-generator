### Step 1: Create Your Monorepo Structure

1. **Create your monorepo directory**:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-monorepo
   cd my-monorepo
   ```

2. **Initialize the root `package.json`**:
   This file will manage shared dependencies and scripts.

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Set up folders for frontend and backend**:

   ```bash
   mkdir frontend backend
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies for Frontend and Backend

Each project (frontend and backend) will have its own `package.json` and dependencies:

- For **frontend** (example: React app):

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm init -y
  npm install react react-dom
  cd ..
  ```

- For **backend** (example: Node.js with Express):

  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm init -y
  npm install express
  cd ..
  ```

### Step 3: Add Root-Level Scripts

You can manage both frontend and backend from the root `package.json` by adding custom scripts.

In the root `package.json`, add the following scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start:frontend": "npm --prefix frontend run start",
  "start:backend": "npm --prefix backend run start",
  "start": "concurrently \"npm run start:frontend\" \"npm run start:backend\""
}
```

- This allows you to start both frontend and backend using one command:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- Install **concurrently** to run multiple processes at the same time:

  ```bash
  npm install concurrently --save-dev
  ```

### Step 4: Configure `.gitignore`

At the root of your monorepo, create a `.gitignore` file to avoid committing unnecessary files:

```
node_modules/
dist/
build/
.env
```

### Step 5: Install Shared Dependencies (Optional)

If you have dependencies that are shared between the frontend and backend, install them at the root of the monorepo:

```bash
npm install eslint prettier
```

### Recap of Directory Structure

Your final directory structure will look like this:

```
my-monorepo/
│
├── package.json       # Root package.json for shared dependencies and scripts
├── frontend/          # Frontend project
│   └── package.json   # Frontend-specific package.json
├── backend/           # Backend project
│   └── package.json   # Backend-specific package.json
└── node_modules/      # Shared node_modules folder
```

This setup focuses entirely on **npm** for managing your frontend and backend projects. Let me know if you'd like to tweak any part of the setup!
